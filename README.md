A watchface in the style of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon (PMD) Sky / Time / Darkness.

It features Time Gears from the game and comes with three backgrounds from the game.

Features (all can be customized):

* Displays time (I think this is pretty importa
* Shows date in month/day or day/month format.
* Displays weather and temperature (Fahrenheit or Celcius) using a forecast.io developer key.
* When your phone was disconnected, the Time Gear get's stolen (a black shadow appears in it's place).
* Your watch will also vibrate if the phone get's disconnected.
* HP bar as step counter with custom step goal.
* "Light" around the Time Gear represents battery level (each is 10%).
